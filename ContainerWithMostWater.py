# Container With Most Water
# Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , 
# where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
# n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
# Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, 
# such that the container contains the most water.
# Example:
# Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49
# Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. 
# In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

# exampe 1:
# Input: height = [1,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,1]. 
# In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 1.  

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        l = len(height)
        left = 0
        right = l - 1
        while left < right:
            result = max(result, min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left))

            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return result
