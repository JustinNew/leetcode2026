# 72. Edit Distance
# Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
# You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
# Insert a character
# Delete a character
# Replace a character

# https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/
# Key is to use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations to convert word1 to word2

class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        m = len(word1)
        n = len(word2)

        dp = [[0 for j in range(n + 1)] for i in range(m + 1)]
        for i in range(m + 1):
            dp[i][n] = m - i
        for j in range(n + 1):
            dp[m][j] = n - j

        for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                if word1[i] == word2[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1], dp[i + 1][j + 1]) + 1

        return dp[0][0]
